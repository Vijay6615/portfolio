        Hey! I’m Vijay Shukla, a 2nd-year IT student who loves turning ideas into interactive digital experiences. I work with HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, React, and Next.js to design clean, modern, and responsive websites that don’t just look good — they feel good to use.

I enjoy experimenting with UI, breaking things while coding, and then fixing them even better than before. Every project I build teaches me something new, and that curiosity keeps me moving forward.

I’m on a journey to become a creative developer who blends design and logic to build meaningful web experiences. Coffee, code, and curiosity — that’s my workflow.
